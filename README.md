# Predicting-Box-Office-Success
The prime motive of this project is to predict the box office revenue of films using machine learning techniques by evaluating historical data, that includes variables such as budget, cast, genre and the release timing. The model helps to understand the pattern and the main factors that might influence a film's financial success.
